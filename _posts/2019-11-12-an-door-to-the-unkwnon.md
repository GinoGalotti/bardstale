Following the not-that-trustworthy word of *Galarath* (the half-gone hermit druid from Athenas), we managed to find the entrance to what should bring us to the depth of Alwayswinter.

With **Barbara the Brave** leading the path, we walked down the long (and not very interesting) corridors covered in mud and dirt, until we started to notice a distant sound of rock against rock. After a longer examination, we realised that the mud was covering gorgeous aery walls made of what it seems to be Glasmere glass beads.

The long corridor ended on a balcony overseeing a vast bottomless well, with staircases going down the sides. One of them was even hidden behind a very clumsy illusion! I mean, even our least arcane-attuned member was able to spot the rouse... but if someone put the effort of hiding it, must be for a reason!

Down the stairs we found an entrance into the mountain: another long alley made of that aery and gorgeous material. But our guts warned us that there was something fishy with the situation, so **Aly** decided...

Quote of the day: 
> "I really like Lidia. She has a very nice mass". 

Remarks:

* Apparently there is a way to get deep down the rabbit's hole!
* It was all very mistical and magical and **DO NOT USE MAGIC ON THE WALLS**.
* Barbara knows how to solve a plank.
* We weren't alone... nasty goblins were waiting for us!
* **DO NOT USE MAGIC TO ATTACK THE BEASTS**. Or, if you do, at least learn how to aim.

(WTF were you expecting? I'm a singer, not a writer, JESUS!)
