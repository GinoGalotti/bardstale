Following the not-that-trustworthy word of *Galarath* (the half-gone hermit druid from Athenas), we managed to find the entrance to what should bring us to the depth of Alwayswinter.

With **Barbara the Brave** leading the path, we walked down the long (and not very interesting) corridors covered in mud and dirt, until we started to notice a distant sound of rock against rock. After a longer examination, we realized that the mud was covering gorgeous aery walls made of what it seems to be Glasmere glass beads.

The long corridor ended on a balcony overseeing a vast bottomless well, with staircases going down the sides. One of them was even hidden behind a very clumsy illusion! I mean, even our least arcane-attuned member was able to spot the rouse... but if someone put the effort of hiding it, it must be for a reason!

Down the stairs we found an entrance into the mountain: another long alley made of that aery and gorgeous material. But our guts warned us that there was something fishy with the situation, so **Aly** decided to use some illusions to lure whatever was hiding in the dark... and there were some of those nasty little goblins!

Luckily we over-smarted those brainless creatures having **Barbara** waiting on the ceiling while the decoy brought them to our hands (and swords). It looked like an easy job till certain someone decided to conjure the spirits of the arcane with her mighty hands but forgot to pay enough attention to actually aim our foes sending the projectiles way pass the goblins and landing on a far away statue. Which, by the game, seems to be actually animated. And not very happy with such a rough wake up...

Quote of the day: 
> "I really like Lidia. She has a very nice mass". 

Remarks:

* Apparently there is a way to get deep down the rabbit's hole!
* It was all very mystical and magical and **DO NOT USE MAGIC ON THE WALLS**.
* Barbara knows how to solve a plank.
* We weren't alone... nasty goblins were waiting for us!
* **DO NOT USE MAGIC TO ATTACK THE BEASTS**. Or, if you do, at least learn how to aim.

(WTF were you expecting? I'm a singer, not a writer, JESUS!)
