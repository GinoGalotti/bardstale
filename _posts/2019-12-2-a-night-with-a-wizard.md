In the hurry of the trip I can't sit down and write this as I would wish, so I will only share some remarks about the latest developments in our journey.

* Spiders are not good company when you just want to chill. Very rude. They try to eat you when you visit them. I'm lucky that Ally decided to throw a rope to me, and Barbara pulled me to safety with her strong, wonderful and loving arms. What a gentlewoman!
* We decided to close the trapdoor and abandon the place. As I said, spiders are awful hosts.
* Going back the stairs, we took the second path down and found a dead end: we found a big entrance door leading to inside the dirt. It seems like if the building wasn't underground when it was built!
* Missing some gl√∂gg we decide to walk back to Alwayswinter and seek some information about the Dragon Tooth or dragons in general. I mean, that's what they said; but I think Bronn was just trying to find and excuse to spend some alone-time with Lidia...
* We were received with a bang! I wasn't expecting any less, I'm such a loved person in the city. You can't walk 10 steps without hearing about me or seeing something that reminds you of me.
* Freja's tower (the city's majestic wizard) was attacked by a dragon! It seems that, when we activated the defense, a Dragon came and asked for Bilborinn... and it didn't like the answers!
* I personally devise a number of brilliant plans to find the dragon: and they all worked. Despite the interference of my own allies! Sometimes I wonder if they are actually wanting to save this world...
* We had a swift visit to the local guardpost accompanied by very supportive and loving guards.
* After a long and resting evening in a proper bed, we met Freja's emissary and learned that the Dragon's Tooth is guarded in a cavern on the mountains of Skenges (a neighboring country). It seems to be guarded by the dragon itself, but it's on best chance to get it! Who knows what's behind that huge majestic door!
* We started our journey to retrieve this magical sword when...

Remarks:

* No animal got hurt on the writing of this story.
* But my feeling did get hurt remembering how my entire team tried to work against me.
* But all my plans proved to work. Even without the support of my crew.
* Tina's pancakes.

(WTF were you expecting? I'm a singer, not a writer, JESUS!)
