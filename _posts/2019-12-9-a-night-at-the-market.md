In the hurry of the trip I can't sit down and write this as I would wish, so I will only share some remarks about the latest developments in our journey.

* We started our journey towards Skagnes. There's no way I could skip this chance of learning from their legendary sense of fashion; so we decided to do our first stop at Nemphyr to gather some precious intel!
* Thanks to **Bronn** we found out that some reckless ruffians were waiting for us on the path, and decided to avoid the confrontation... I was in no mood to teaching them manners after such a long journey!
* Upon reaching to Nemphyr we stopped at the Grim Griffon where Sam politely asked me to enlighten people's days with my melodic baritone voice. What can one say, I'm used to people needing my art!
* In the meantime, my companions engaged in a conversation with Vardin, the dragon-lover. He spent a lot of time studying *Dillsdranamt* (the dragon), tracking its cycles and controlling its diet. He didn't seem to have much interesting information.
* *The Serpent* came to us searching for a group of adventurers from the North who seem to be related to Bilborinn and a dragon, but luckily some catchy songs about birds eating pathetic worms made them feel uncomfortable enough that they decided to drop the chase... I can't stand people who can't handle a little bit of joking.
* When getting out to do some nice evening shopping, we realized we were being followed by a gang of odd-looking thugs... what a dreadful style! We created a useful diversion while gathering a crowd by sharing some of my freshly-produced tunes about Worms, Dragons and lack of style; I didn't manage to make the thugs dance, but it was enough to let **Alannah** and **Bronn** sneak out unnoticed!
* When they called the guards on us for public disturbance, we saw our friends running from some priests and getting cornered on a dodgy alley; so we decided it was time for a rescue!
* **Aly** almost got hit by a stray arrow, creating some commotion on the crowd. I bet she's grateful for being barely the size of a functional adult! You never know when that can save your life. On a surprising turn of events, she decided to conceal the arrow and create some illusion so the guards focus their eyes somewhere else instead of going for our dear friends!
* I found **Alannah** and **Bronn** in a pickle with two ugly-faced fellas and devised to help them by bringing some unwanted attention... everyone should see what is the Serpent spending all that tax-money on! It didn't seem to draw enough people in, but my argument was compelling enough that the Worm priest decided to tap on his colleague's back with a spikey scepter, knocking him down...
* We all managed to run far from the conflict and deal with the thugs and decided to take some rest and prepare the game plan.
* On the next day, **Alannah** visited the Dove's local spot and learn that the Serpent seems to be the de facto power of the city. They seem to be more active since we interacted with Bilborinn's ruins and are trying to locate us. 
* **Ally** talked with Elsa the Scholar and learned about *Dragons and other legendary creatures*. It seems to be a myth that they're hoarders, dragons to be really difficult to harm as they only have something really specific they are weak to. She also inquired about *Legendary swords and other artifacts that would shape history*, learning that the Tooth of a Dragon is one of its kind, as no one else has been able to forge a weapon from a dragon's part. It was forged in the Great Forge, and hopefully, they are other majestic creations waiting for us there!
* I follow the rumors and gossips: it seems that the Scarred visited the dragon and came back "alive"! It sounds like someone very interesting to visit before our adventure.
* **Bronn** learned from the Merchants that The Serpents are following our path (even if they're not aware we are their target), and some people think that the great Serpent might have some connection to a dragon...
* Our last stop was visiting the Scarred. Poor soul. After making him feel like the hero he would never be, he described *Dillsdranamt* as a ferocious and blood-seeking beast... he might not be the most objective source, tho!

Quote of the day:
> When in doubt, just make out

Remarks:

* Don't underestimate the power of an annoying song. It gets the job done.
* **Ally** can't share food. She has to have her own portion. No going for tapas with her.
* You can carry up to four capes without looking suspicious.
* We still don't know if Elsa wanted to build a snowman.
* If you get 70% of your body burned and are unable to participate in a coherent conversation anymore, people will forget your name and call you *Scarred*.

(WTF were you expecting? I'm a singer, not a writer, JESUS!)
