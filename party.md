Do you really think I had enough time to write about you? C'mon. Give me some rest.

I will try to expand on it someday. Probably even today. Nah. Not today.

## Aleaneah

She's as kind as she's naive, but it's incredibly amusing seeing the works of all The Dove indoctrination on a person. But one can feel her warm, big heart; but she doesn't seem very impressed by my attempts of showing her the actual _pleasures_ of life. 

## Barbara the Hungry

I still can't believe I crossed paths with this force of nature. She is such a big inspiration for my tales, being the perfect embodiment of the hero who's never afraid. Such a marvelous piece of art couldn't be even sculpted by the one and only Angel Mikael; it's mesmerizing looking at all those muscles tensing and dancing... regardless of what she's doing!

## Aldara

There is something unique about this kid, a little something that tells me she'll be part of something very, very big. And I want to be there with her when it happens. As a renown storyteller, I can spot these details from miles away! And she is exactly what I need to get the notoriety I deserve! I'll be the one singing about Aldara's adventures!

She's also an outsider 

## Bronn

Calm. Nurturing. And deadly. Oh, Bronn. I always feel safer when I have him traveling with me. I will write more about him when I have more time.
Lidia. Oh. I don't understand what he's doing with her. I don't really understand their relationship either. I think he's just missing the attention, so I will have to up my wing-man game...

## The rest

Friends come and go. Like the wind. That is life. Do you expect me to remember their names? Fuck no.
