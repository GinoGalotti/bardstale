The code I used to cipher my notes is lost, so I could only recover little glimpses of them. I will upload these notes as soon as I get them.

## The nice ones

**Tina (Innkeeper)**: She makes mean cinnamon rolls. I can't say no to her. She's the owner of Happy Rooster (Alwayswinter).
**Sam (Inkeeper)**: He's in charge of the Grim Griffin, and very appreciative of the good arts and beautiful voices. 5/5 stars boar.
**Freja**: Legendary wizard from Alwayswinter, seems to know about Bilborin!
**Vardin**: Pokemon-trainer wannabe who is obssesed with dragons, currently living in Nemphyr. Whatever floats your boat, mate!

## The bad ones

With my charm, there is no one who would hold a grudge to me.

**Dillsdranamt**: Big nasty dragon that seems to be keeping a powerful artifact. And, even more important, it destroyed Freja's home!

## The ugly ones

A list of those who would never have minstrels singing about them

**Lidia**: Just look at her. No heroic tale can be told about one such as her.
