A summary of all the relevant places and history we've visited

## Places

**Alwayswinter**: Biggest settlement of the area, mainly of Human population. Ancient songs talk about a powerful Elvish civilization living on the place before human came, but any remains of it seem to be wiped out.
**Mines of Glashmere**: Source of those glorious glass beads praised by her astonishing looks and her mysterious magical qualities.
**Athenas**: Home of the posh, fancy and irritating society elves. They are just too full of themselves. 

## Societies

**The elves far away**: I'm fascinated by these unique creatures able to succeed on the most incredible of physical challenges. It's mesmerizing looking at The Hungry devouring one dish after the other... I can feel the chills just by remembering that! 

## Deities

**The dove**: A God of second chances and redemption. T
