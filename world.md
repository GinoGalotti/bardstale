A summary of all the relevant places and history we've visited

## Places

**Alwayswinter**: Biggest settlement of the area, mainly of Human population. Ancient songs talk about a powerful Elvish civilization living on the place before human came, but any remains of it seem to be wiped out.
**Mines of Glashmere**: Source of those glorious glass beads praised by her astonishing looks and her mysterious magical qualities.
**Athenas**: Home of the posh, fancy and irritating society elves. They are just too full of themselves. 
**Vilborimm**: Ruins of a previous Elvish civilisation underneath Alwayswinter.

## Societies

**The elves far away**: I'm fascinated by these unique creatures able to succeed on the most incredible of physical challenges. It's mesmerizing looking at The Hungry devouring one dish after the other... I can feel the chills just by remembering that! 

## Deities

**The Dove**: A God of second chances and redemption. I will write more here when I feel pias.
**The Serpent**: Aka the worms, aka soggy noodles. This powerful religion count with many adepts, and preaches the internal power we all have despite our physical weaknesses and limitations. Its broad appeal makes it very sticky, but it's obvious to anyone with some some common sense how corrupt and poisonous its high spheres are. I mean, which religion of good would pick a serpent as a symbol!
